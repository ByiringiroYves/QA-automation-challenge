      # --- CRITICAL CORRECTION HERE: Backend Server Start ---
      # You have two 'Start Backend API' steps, and one uses 'npm start' while the other uses 'node server.js'.
      # Also, the 'PORT' environment variable must be set for the server.js to use it.
      # Let's combine and correct this.

      - name: Start Backend API (for all tests)
        run: |
          # The 'npm start' command in node-backend/package.json should be 'node server.js'
          # This command needs to run in the background. 'nohup' and '&' are for this.
          # We export the PORT variable so server.js can pick it up.
          export PORT=5000 # Make sure this matches your server.js and Playwright config if it's external
          nohup npm start > backend.log 2>&1 & # Use npm start if defined, or node server.js directly
          # Capture PID to ensure it can be killed later if needed (though GitHub Actions cleans up)
          echo "Backend PID: $!" > backend_pid.txt
          echo "Waiting for backend to start on port $PORT..."
          # Wait until the /items endpoint (which requires auth but confirms server is up) is reachable
          curl --fail --retry 10 --retry-delay 5 http://localhost:$PORT/items || (echo "Backend not ready after multiple retries!" && cat backend.log && exit 1)
          echo "Backend is ready."
        working-directory: ./node-backend # IMPORTANT: Run this from the backend directory
